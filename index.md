### ABOUT ME

I did my undergrad in IT (BSIT) from [NUST SEECS Islamabad](http://seecs.nust.edu.pk/), and received Rector's Gold Medal for BS Dissertation. For graduate studies I studied Distributed Computing (EMDC/MSc) from [UPC Barcelona](https://www.ac.upc.edu/emdc) and [KTH Stockholm](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/emdc). I interned at [Telefonica Research Barcelona](http://www.tid.es/) for [MS dissertation](http://www.ac.upc.edu/emdc-master-thesis). In between I was working as a visiting scientist at [SLAC, Stanford](http://maggie.seecs.nust.edu.pk/team.html) for the [PingER project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PingER_Project).

I was a part of the [NetOS research group](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/) at the [Computer Laboratory](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge. I was supervised by [Prof. Jon Crowcroft](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jac22/). During my [Ph.D. research](https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.26395) I worked on characterising, detecting and measuring the social cost of automated programs (bots) in online social networks (OSNs). For this purpose, I developed [Stweeler](https://github.com/zafargilani/stcs). The Stweeler project was aimed at studying usage, behaviour and impact of automated agents (bots, automated entities, automated agents) in online social networks (OSNs). To measure the social cost of bots I studied their influence over content popularity, the affects of bot traffic generated and propagated over networked systems, and the types of bots that are part of our electronic social settings. For these purposes the Stweeler project collects and maintains massive amounts of Twitter data from the freely available Streaming API. Since Stweeler collects all of the tweets from the Streaming API, we can use this dataset for a number of other avenues of research, such as sentiment analysis, and sociopolitical analysis, among others.

Currently, I hold multiple positions at the University of Hong Kong, QMUL and Enzen Global Solutions Ltd.
